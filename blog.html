One-third of Sub Pop supergroup Loma, Emily Cross released her second full-length album under her solo project Cross Record last Friday. The self titled sophomore release comes three years after her debut, during which time Cross took time off of music to start a career as a death doula. Read her Bandcamp Daily interview about the new record and her time away from music here, and listen to Cross Record (out now on Ba Da Bing Records) below.

Their highly lauded 2018 debut full-length, Foreplay, is chock full of mild-paced, optimistic but introspective guitar-driven numbers–listen here.

<span style="font-size:27px;">Forces At Play: Alex Hungtai & Love Theme</span><br>
<span style="font-size:18px;"> Posted on September 20, 2018 </span>
</p>
<p><img src="img/blog4.jpg" class="align-left"/>
Alex Hungtai is a tenable genius–musically, stylistically, philosophically and otherwise. The creative force behind the late Dirty Beaches, a lo-fi lounge-y / post-rockabilly / apocalyptic dance project, Hungtai’s croon has drawn comparisons to Elvis and Roy Orbison. Three years following the disbandment of Dirty Beaches, Alex is back with a new project, Love Theme, embracing the noisiest aspects of his former project. Love Theme creates experimental, drone music that can’t help but feel somewhat romantic–think Angelo Badalamenti’s score for Twin Peaks (appropriate, considering Hungtai makes an appearance in the new season of the show, appearing in a band alongside David Lynch’s son).

This June, Love Theme released their debut, self titled album which drew praise from the likes of Pitchfork, Consequence Of Sound, The Fader, Exclaim and more. Recently Hungtai was even featured in The New York Times ‘Men’s Style’ section, with a lovely interview correspondence that highlights his travels through Cairo, Beirut, Taipei and Montreal, as well as his personal philosophies on life, fashion and travel.

On Saturday, September 30, catch Alex Hungtai with Love Theme at Holocene, joined by Portland’s own futuristic lounge crooner Mattress and LA’s ethereal Sun Pack. Advance tickets are available here. Enter to win a pair of tickets here. RSVP and invite friends to the event.
